# progsynth-final-project
Final project for CS 393P Program Synthesis

This is an implementation of PROPEL (Imitation-Projected Programmatic Reinforcement Learning) with NDPS (Neurally Directed Program Search), a programmatic reinforcement learning algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05431. This code is largely based off of the code linked in the paper.
